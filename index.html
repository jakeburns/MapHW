<h1 align = "middle">Mistakes People make with Map Visualizations</h1>
<p>One mistake people often make when creating map visualizations is if the map involves circles that show how much of a certain thing, they tend to double the size of the diameters as the numbers increase, but that really quadruples the area. Instead you want to double the area instead of quadrupling it.</p>
<p>Another mistake people make is overlapping a bunch of circles in an area. They have them all jumbled over each other so you can't even tell what's going on. A better way to do this is to have the smaller circles be on top of the bigger ones and even make them see through if you can so it's easier to tell how big a circle is.</p>
